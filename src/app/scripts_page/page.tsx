            There are several types of models involved in the AGE-PRO collaboration in order to compare disk evolution
             simulations with the AGE-PRO data. This includes: thermochemical models, disk population models, 
             dust evolution and radiative transfer simulations.

            Trapman et al. (AGE-PRO V) uses the thermochemical code DALI introduced in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A&A...541A..91B">Bruderer et al. (2012)</a>.  
            DALI iteratively computes the disk&apos;s chemical and thermal structure by solving radiative transfer, 
            time-dependent chemistry, and heating/cooling balance. It determines dust and gas temperatures and 
            molecular excitation. For our AGE-PRO calculations, it also includes CO isotope-selective chemistry 
            and photodissociation. To request access to DALI and the scripts used in this work, 
            please contact <a href="mailto:ke.zhang@wisc.edu">Dr. Coco Zhang.</a>
            </p>

            <p className={styles.description}>
            Kurtovic et al. (AGE-PRO VI) and Anania et al. (AGE-PRO VIII) use Dustpy, which is a gas and dust 
            evolution code introduced in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...35S/abstract">Stammler & Birnstiel (2022)</a>, which includes the dynamics and growth of 
            dust particles simultaneously in protoplanetary disks based on the work of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...513A..79B/abstract">Birnstiel et al. (2010).</a> Dustpy 
            is publicly available at <a href="https://stammler.github.io/dustpy/">https://stammler.github.io/dustpy/</a>.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.description}>
            In Kurtovic et al. (AGE-PRO VI), both the gas and dust evolution are calculated. For gas evolution, 
            it is assumed viscous evolution, while for the dust evolution different models with dust traps 
            were assumed. In Kurtovic et al. (AGE-PRO VI), radiative transfer models were performed using 
            the publicly available code RADMC-3D, published in Dullemond et al. (2012). For the calculation of 
            the dust opacities, we use optool, published in Dominik et al. (2021).   
            To access the scripts used to run the Dustpy, RADMC-3D, or optool calculations used in the 
            AGE-PRO collaboration, please contact Dr. Nicolas Kurtovic.

            <p className={styles.description}>
            In Anania et al. (AGE-PRO VIII) both gas and dust evolution models of smooth discs were performed 
            using the grid-based code DustPy Stammler & Birnstiel 2022. For these models, external 
            photoevaporation is included based on the work by Garate et al. (2024) and Sellek et al. (2020), 
            using the FRIED grid developed by Tom Haworth, recently updated and published in 
            Haworth et al. (2023). A repository with the latest implementation of external photoevaporation 
            in Dustpy is available at:
            https://github.com/Rossella4712/External_Photoevaporation_FRIEDv2_module_dustpy

            <p className={styles.description}>
            In Tabone et al. (AGE-PRO VII) the gas evolution of protoplanetary disks is modelled either using 
            viscous evolution or MHD wind-driven evolution as analytically implemented in Tabone et al. 2022. 
            The viscous evolution models include photoevaporation from X-ray irradiation from the central star, 
            as explained in Picogna et al. (2021). For the population synthesis models, we use the Diskpop 
            python package developed by Somigliana et al. (2024). To request access to the scripts use in 
            Tabone et al. (AGE-PRO VII), please contact Dr. Beno√Æ Tabone.
